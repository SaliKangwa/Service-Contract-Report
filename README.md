<h1> Service-Contract-Report</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project involved developing a Power BI report to monitor contract approvals, Contract Officer performance, and overall contract costs. The report provided a centralized dashboard for tracking key contract metrics, enabling better oversight and management. Additionally, an SSRS report was created to support contract lifecycle management by automating alerts for upcoming renewals, expiring contracts, and expired contracts. The system was designed to enhance contract visibility and streamline administrative processes.
